- In order to gain a comprehensive overview of our lending operations and
monitor the performance of loans, we aim to create a grid view report
categorized by Loan Status.
- By providing insights into metrics such as
o Total Loan Applications
o Total Funded Amount
o Total Amount Received
o Month-to-Date (MTD) Funded Amount
o MTD Amount Received
o Average Interest Rate
o Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)
- This Analytics Report will empower us to make data-driven decisions
and assess the health of our loan portfolio.
